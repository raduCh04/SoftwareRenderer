# Line Drawing Algorithms

## Overview

In computer graphics, drawing a line is one of the fundamental tasks. There are several algorithms for drawing lines between two points. The most basic equation for drawing a line in a 2D space is derived from the **linear equation**:

### General Line Equation

The general form of the line equation is given by:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

Where:
- $y$ is the y-coordinate of any point on the line.
- $x$ is the x-coordinate of the point.
- $m$ is the **slope** of the line, defined as:

$$
m = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0}
$$

- $b$ is the **y-intercept**, calculated as:

$$
b = y_0 - m \cdot x_0
$$

Here, $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$ are the two endpoints of the line.

## Line Drawing Algorithms

There are different ways to compute the points on the line between $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$. Let's look at a few common methods.

### 1. **Naive Line Drawing (Mathematical Equation)**

The simplest way to draw a line is by using the mathematical formula above to calculate the y-value for each x-coordinate between $x_0$ and $x_1$. 

#### Steps
1. Calculate the slope $m$ and the y-intercept $b$.
2. For each integer value of $x$ between $x_0$ and $x_1$, calculate the corresponding $y$-value using the equation:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

3. Draw the point $(x, y)$ for each calculated $x$-value.

#### Performance Considerations

- This approach is inefficient due to its reliance on floating-point arithmetic and rounding functions.

- It lacks precision for lines with very steep or very shallow slopes, which can result in visible artifacts.

- Rounding operations may introduce gaps or jagged edges in the rendered line.

- While not suitable for performance-critical applications, it is simple to implement and useful for educational purposes or prototyping.

### 2. Incremental Line Drawing Algorithm
This Algorithm is mostly the same as the first **Naive Line Drawing Algorithm** with only one exeption, the $y$ calculation. In the previous algorithm the $y$ was calculated using the mathematical formula $y = mx + b$. To try and optimize it, we can try and evaluate how y changes with each next x:
$$
F(x, y) = mx - y + b, F(x + 1, y) = m(x + 1) - y + b \\
$$
$$
F(x + 1, y) - F(x, y) = m
$$
This tells us that y increases always by the same value m. This is quite a minor improvement over the first algorithm, however it shows us a way to check for same changes in an equation, which will be useful for the Bresenham Algorithm.

### 3. DDA Line Drawing Algorithm

The **Digital Differential Analyzer** is a line drawing algorithm based on the incremental difference between the x and y coordinates in the two endpoints.

#### Steps
1. Calculate the differenece $(dx, dy)$ between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the endpoints.
2. Choose the number of $steps$ needed to plot the line by choosing the greater difference $max(|dx|, |dy|)$.
3. Calculate the steps for incrementing the x and y coordinates.
$$
x_{\text{step}}= \frac{dx}{steps} \quad y_{\text{step}} = \frac{dy}{steps}
$$
4. Starting from the initial point $(x_0,y_0)$, add $x_{\text{step}}$â€‹ and $y_{\text{step}}$ at each iteration and plot the point until the final point $(x_1,y_1)$ is reached.

#### Performance Considerations

- The DDA algorithm provides more consistent results than the naive method, especially across different slopes.

- It still involves floating-point division and repeated additions, which may be computationally expensive on certain platforms.

- It is well-suited for applications requiring uniform and predictable stepping between points.

- The algorithm produces smoother and more uniform lines than the naive approach, particularly on low-resolution displays or long segments.

### 4. Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm
This algorithm is based on the fact that the actual y coordinate is most of the time always between two pixel, $y_k$ or $y_k+1$. This allows us to draw the line more accurately since we do not round all the values. This means we can choose whever to increase $y$ or not, by calculating the distances from the actual y-value to y_k and y_k+1:


#### Steps:
1. Calculate the slope and the y intercept
2. For each integer value of $x$ between $x_0$ and $x_1$, calculate the corresponding $y$-value using the equation:

$$
y = mx + b
$$
3. if $y > 0.5$ then increment $y_k$
3. Draw the point $(x, y_k)$ for each calculated $x$-value.
### 5. Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm
This algorithm is the most efficient algorithm for drawing lines, because it uses only integer values and additions. It is based on the Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm, with the idea of the $y$-value being between two pixels. To increment or not to icrement, that's the question. We will use the so called decision parameter.

#### Steps:
1. First of all we need to calculate the first decision D, as a starting point.
$$
F(x_0 + 1, y + \frac{1}{2})  = m(x_0+1) - (y + \frac{1}{2}) + b \\\iff mx_0 + m - y - \frac{1}{2} + b \\ \iff (mx_0 - y + b) + (m - \frac{1}{2}) \\ = F(x_0, y_0) + (m - \frac{1}{2})
$$
$$
m - \frac{1}{2} \iff \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} - \frac{1}{2}  \iff \delta y - \frac{1}{2} * \delta x \iff 2 * \delta y -\delta x \\
$$
$$
D := 2 * \delta x - \delta y
$$
